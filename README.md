# Auxilium 

We all have to live through this difficult time during the COVID-19 epidemic and many of us have lost our physical connection to our friends and relatives. It is tough being alone or having limited contact with people. We as a team realized this and have channeled our love for coding and technology through our app Auxilium. 

## General Info
Our app will help re-establish the connection we all have lost by connecting you with others in a thread/post social media system! We all need to connect, depend and help each other!

## Technologies
The application is created using MERN:
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* React.js & Redux
* Node.js
